## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Your `.env` File  

Before getting started, configure your environment variables and folders. Copy the sample configuration:  

```bash
mkdir logs data reports .kube
cp sample.env .env
```

##### Configure Environment Variables  

These environment variables are essential for connecting to **K8** & **Loki** (Note: if you are using linux, swap `http://host.docker.internal` with your host machine's local IP).

*If you do not wish to start with your Loki production logs, [use this simulation repository](https://github.com/dingus-technology/INFRASTRUCTURE-SIMULATION) for creating simulated logs locally*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using colima

If running on mac, use colima for reduced overheads rather that Docker Desktop

```bash
colima start
```

## üê≥ Running with Docker

### 1. Build & Start the Docker Container

Run the following command to build and start everything:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will pull dependencies, build the image, and fire up the container.

### 2. Enter the App Container

```bash
docker compose exec dingus bash
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Run Code Checks

Keep your code clean and formatted:

```bash
format-checks
code-checks
```
