# [Dingus](https://www.dingusai.dev) ‚Äì Advanced Bug Identification and Debugging

![Dingus Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

Dingus isn‚Äôt just another log viewer - it‚Äôs your debugging partner. Instead of drowning in dashboards and grepping through logs, Dingus automatically:

* Surfaces the issues that actually matter
* Traces them back to your codebase
* Suggests practical fixes you can apply immediately

### Why Developers Use Dingus

* **Zero guesswork** ‚Üí Know *what* broke and *where* in minutes, not hours
* **Context-rich insights** ‚Üí See errors in the bigger picture of your system
* **Code-first debugging** ‚Üí Jump straight from anomalies to actionable fixes

If you‚Äôve ever burned a day chasing a production bug that turned out to be something trivial, Dingus was built for you.


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### Kubernetes Config

For Dingus to observe your K8s cluster, place your kube config in the top-level directory:

```bash
DINGUS/.kube/config
```

### Running on Mac (Colima Recommended)

On macOS, use [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) for reduced overhead compared to Docker Desktop:

```bash
colima start
```

## üê≥ Run Dingus with Docker

### Build & Start

Spin everything up in one step:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Once running, open [http://0.0.0.0:8501/](http://0.0.0.0:8501/) and add your configs.

üëâ No production logs handy? Try our [simulation repo](https://github.com/dingus-technology/INFRASTRUCTURE-SIMULATION) to generate fake logs locally.

> **Note:** Not on MacOS? Replace `http://host.docker.internal` with your host machine‚Äôs local IP in `DINGUS/docker-compose`.


## ‚úÖ Development: Run Code Checks

Keep the codebase clean and consistent:

```bash
docker compose exec dingus bash
```

Then run:

```bash
format-checks
code-checks
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Configuration

Set environment variables by copying the sample file:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

These are required for connecting Dingus to **K8s** and **Loki**.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?

* Hook Dingus up to your real cluster and logs
* Start catching bugs **before they catch you**
* Move from reactive firefighting to proactive debugging
