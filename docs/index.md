# Why Developers Use Dingus
Dingus is a tool to gather critical insights and recommend fixes, making it easier and faster to resolve production issues. Instead of drowning in dashboards and grepping through logs, Dingus automatically:

* Surfaces the issues that actually matter.
* Traces them back to the root.
* Suggests practical fixes you can apply immediately.

Dingus reviews logs, metrics, code, commits and more in order to build a holistic view of what casued a production issue.

* **Zero guesswork** ‚Üí Know *what* broke and *where* in minutes, not hours.
* **Context-rich insights** ‚Üí See errors in the bigger picture of your system.
* **Faster debugging** ‚Üí Jump straight from anomalies to fixes.

If you‚Äôve ever burned a day chasing a production bug that turned out to be something trivial, Dingus was built for you.

## Workflows That Just Flow ‚Äì Connect the in Dots Seconds, Not Hours
We don‚Äôt believe in replacing your existing tools. Instead, we integrate with them to create a seamless experience. Our goal is to help you resolve issues faster by providing the right information and suggesting effective fixes.
